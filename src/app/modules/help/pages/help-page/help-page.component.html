        Virtual rooms can be used for multiple conference calls (e.g., periodic
        meetings). The room can be created for longer period of time (a number
        of years), but throughout the period it isn't automatically available
        for participants to join. For each conference call in the virtual room
        you must book capacity, which determines how many participants will be
        able to join to the room. The virtual room gets assigned identifiers on
        creation which don't change throughout the room's existence (if you
        don't requet a change). Thus the identifiers are the same for all
        conference calls that take place in the virtual room.

        Reservation system manages hardware and software equipment (referred to
        as <b>resources</b>), which provides the creation and management of
        virtual rooms. Each resource has only a limited number of licenses that
        can be used at a time. For instance if you want to join an Adobe Connect
        room, the resource must have at least one available license, otherwise
        it won't allow you to join the room. After joining the room the license
        is consumed and after leaving the room the license is released. To be
        able to guarantee a specific number of participants to be able to join
        to every room, it is necessery to book the licenses in advance. That is
        the reason why you must explicitly book a requested capacity for each
        room when you want to use it (when booking a capacity for virtual room).

          Each room can contain different number of chairs at different times.
          For every meeting in every room, the chairs must be booked in advance,
