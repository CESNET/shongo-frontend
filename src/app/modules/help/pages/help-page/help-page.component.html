        Only logged in user with a certain level of authenticity can create a

      <ul>
        <li>
          Request your identity provider to verify your identity (e.g., if you
          use

          Request the system

        Reservation system manages hardware and software equipment (referred to
        as <b>resources</b>), which provides the creation and management of
        virtual rooms. Each resource has only a limited number of licenses that
        can be used at a time. For instance if you want to join an Adobe Connect
        room, the resource must have at least one available license, otherwise
        it won't allow you to join the room. After joining the room the license
        is consumed and after leaving the room the license is released. To be
        able to guarantee a specific number of participants to be able to join
        to every room, it is necessery to book the licenses in advance. That is
        the reason why you must explicitly book a requested capacity for each
        room when you want to use it (e.g., when creating a new one-time room or
        when booking a capacity for permanent room).
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >You can imagine the resource as a building in which few rooms are
          located and the limited number of licenses you can imagine as chairs
          located in this building and which may be moved between the rooms.
          Each room can contain different number of chairs at different times.
          For every meeting in every room, the chairs must be booked in advance,
          otherwise it may happen that participants won't be able to sit
          down.</i
